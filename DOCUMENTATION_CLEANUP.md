# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-22  
**Branch**: main

## Changes Made

### README.md

- ❌ Port 7071 (Functions port)
- ❌ Duplicate "Deployments (CI/CD)" sections
- ❌ Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) deployment details
- ❌ Confusing multi-paragraph explanations

**Added:**
- ✅ Clean, concise "Overview" and "Architecture" sections
- ✅ Simplified deployment section (no SWA references)
- ✅ Comprehensive **Documentation Index** at bottom with organized links
- ✅ Streamlined explanations focusing on current Express architecture

**Improvements:**
- Reduced redundancy and verbosity
- Clearer port allocation table (removed legacy ports)
- Focused on Docker + Express as primary architecture
- Better organization with clear sections

### docs/development/architecture.md

**Removed:**
- ❌ "Migration Status" section (moved to MIGRATION_STATUS.md)
- ❌ "Pending Migrations" list (outdated)
- ❌ References to Azure Functions legacy code
- ❌ Nginx/multi-port deployment options
- ❌ Confusing port allocation matrix

**Updated:**
- ✅ Simplified component description (Express + Vite + Docker)
- ✅ Clear port allocation table (dev: 4000, production: 3000)
- ✅ Updated deployment options (Docker Compose recommended)
- ✅ Added "API Endpoints" section with authentication levels
- ✅ Streamlined architecture overview

**Focus:**
- Current containerized Express architecture
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flows
- Docker deployment patterns
- Clear separation of dev vs production ports

### New Documentation

**Created:**
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Simple, bullet-point guide for non-developers
  - Local deployment (4 steps)
  - Production deployment (4 steps)
  - GitHub OAuth setup walkthrough
  - Troubleshooting section
  - Cost estimates

## Documentation Index (Added to README)

The README now includes a comprehensive documentation index organized by category:

### Getting Started
- Deployment Guide
- Quick Start
- Troubleshooting

### Deployment
- AZD Deployment
- Production Database Setup
- Infrastructure Guide

### Development
- Architecture
- AGENTS.md
- Environment Variables
- OAuth Configuration
- OAuth API Authentication
- Database Schema
- Migration Status

### Usage
- GitHub Action Setup
- Batch Scanning
- Security Analysis
- Docker Guide

### Testing
- Test Coverage

## Files Modified

```
M  README.md                          (major cleanup, added index)
M  docs/development/architecture.md   (removed legacy, simplified)
A  DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md                (new: simple deployment steps)
```

## Legacy References Removed

### From README.md:
- Azure Functions architecture description
- `packages/api` references
- Port 7071 mentions
- Azure Static Web Apps deployment
- SWA CLI deployment workflow details
- Duplicate deployment sections
- Legacy migration status

### From architecture.md:
- "Legacy Azure Functions" component
- `dev/api-legacy-azure-functions` branch references
- Migration status tracking
- Pending migrations list
- Azure Functions port allocation
- Multi-container vs single-container complexity

## Remaining Legacy References (Intentional)

The following documents still reference Azure Functions for historical/migration tracking purposes:

- `docs/development/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Migration tracking document
- `docs/development/EXPRESS_MIGRATION_MATRIX.md` - Detailed migration matrix
- `docs/development/EXPRESS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Migration plan
- `docs/development/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` - Includes "Legacy Variables" section

These are **intentionally preserved** for:
- Historical reference
- Migration tracking
- Development context
- Complete documentation of the transition

## Key Improvements

1. **Clarity**: Removed confusing dual-architecture descriptions
2. **Conciseness**: Eliminated redundant sections and explanations
3. **Organization**: Added comprehensive documentation index
4. **Focus**: Emphasized current Express/Docker architecture
5. **Accessibility**: Created simple deployment guide for non-developers
6. **Maintenance**: Easier to update with single source of truth for architecture

## Next Steps (Optional)

If further cleanup desired:

1. **Review other docs/** files for legacy references:
   - `docs/usage/PORT_ALLOCATION.md` (has Azure Functions port info)
   - `docs/usage/DOCKER_COMPOSE_GUIDE.md` (migration section)
   - `docs/development/SCRIPTS_AUDIT.md` (setup.sh references)

2. **Consider archiving legacy docs:**
   - Move EXPRESS_MIGRATION_*.md to `docs/legacy/` folder
   - Keep for reference but separate from active docs

3. **Update inline code comments:**
   - Check for "Azure Functions" comments in codebase
   - Update outdated package path references

## Validation

- ✅ README.md is concise and digestible
- ✅ Architecture docs reflect current state
- ✅ No broken links in documentation index
- ✅ Legacy content properly archived/noted
- ✅ Deployment guide ready for PPT conversion
