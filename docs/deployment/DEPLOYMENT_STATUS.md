# FINAL FIXES SUMMARY - What Was Done

## 1. Database Connection Fix ✅

- **Fixed**: `docker-compose.yml` line 26 now respects `.env` settings
- **Before**: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/template-doctor` (hardcoded)
- **After**: `MONGODB_URI=${MONGODB_URI:-mongodb://mongodb:27017/template-doctor}`
- **Result**: Local dev uses local MongoDB by default, but can use Cosmos DB if `MONGODB_URI` is set in `.env`
- **Production**: Already using Cosmos DB correctly (verified in Azure)

## 2. Setup Page Padding Removed ✅

- **Fixed**: `packages/app/setup.html` body padding changed from `20px` to `0`
- **Built**: Confirmed in `packages/app/dist/setup.html`
- **Result**: Edge-to-edge layout

## 3. Leaderboards Toggle - PARTIALLY COMPLETE

### What Works:

- Toggle switch exists and functions
- Banner shows/hides correctly
- Console logging works
- API calls are made to `/api/v4/leaderboards/*`
- Green "Live" badges appear on sections with real data

### What Still Needs Fixing:

**The demo data is still hardcoded in the HTML**. I started to fix this but ran into token limits.

### What Needs To Be Done:

1. **Move demo data to JSON file** - Already created at `packages/app/public/data/leaderboards-demo.json`
2. **Update leaderboards.html** to:
    - Remove all hardcoded data arrays (lines ~757-880 in current file)
    - Load demo data from JSON using `loadDemoData()` function (already added)
    - Show placeholder messages for empty sections when in Live mode
3. **Update `loadLeaderboards()` function** to:
    ```javascript
    if (useDemoData) {
        leaderboardData = await loadDemoData(); // Load from JSON
    } else {
        // Fetch from API - already implemented
        // Show placeholders for empty responses
    }
    ```

## 4. Pre-Deploy Checklist Script ✅

- **Created**: `scripts/pre-deploy-checklist.sh`
- **Verified**: All builds pass
- **Ready**: Can deploy anytime

## Current Status:

### ✅ READY TO DEPLOY:

- Database connection respects environment
- Setup page padding fixed
- Server TypeScript built
- Frontend built
- Docker image builds successfully

### ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL FIX (< 5 minutes):

The leaderboards.html file needs the hardcoded demo data arrays removed. The structure is there, just need to clean up the orphaned data lines.

## To Complete and Deploy:

1. Clean up `packages/app/leaderboards.html`:
    - Find and delete all hardcoded data arrays between lines ~757-880
    - Keep only the `loadDemoData()` function and render functions

2. Rebuild:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/pre-deploy-checklist.sh
    ```

3. Deploy:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/deploy.sh
    ```

## Why Toggle Appears Not To Work Locally:

The local MongoDB database is empty, so:

- API returns `{"data": [], "available": true}`
- Frontend sees empty array, falls back to demo data
- Result: Same data shown whether toggle is on or off

**To see it work**: Either add data to local MongoDB OR test in production after deployment (which has Cosmos DB with data from yesterday's analysis).
