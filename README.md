Template Doctor analyzes and validates samples and templates, including but not limited to Azure Developer CLI (azd) templates. It provides a web UI to view analysis results and take action, including opening GitHub issues and assigning them to GitHub copilot in one go. It also automates PR updates with scan results.

# Overview

Template Doctor is a containerized application that analyzes and validates samples and templates, with a focus on Azure Developer CLI (azd) templates. It provides:

- **Web UI**: TypeScript-based Vite SPA for viewing analysis results and managing templates
- **REST API**: Express backend for validation, OAuth, and GitHub integration
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based architecture for consistent development and production environments
- **One-Click Actions**: GitHub issue creation with AI-powered suggestions and automated PR updates

## Features

- **Template Analysis**: Validate templates against organization standards and best practices
- **Interactive Web UI**: TypeScript-based Vite SPA for viewing and managing analysis results
- **Security Analysis**: Bicep security checks for Managed Identity, insecure auth patterns, and anonymous access
- **AI Integration**: One-click GitHub issue creation with AI-powered suggestions
- **Automated Workflows**: PR updates with scan results and deployment testing
- **Azure Developer CLI (azd)**: AZD deployment validation and testing
- **AI Model Checks**: Automated deprecation checking for AI models
- **Centralized Archive**: Metadata storage for analysis results
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated API smoke tests and deployment workflows

## Architecture

Template Doctor is a **containerized monorepo** with independently deployable packages:

### Current Architecture (Express-based)

- **packages/app**: Vite SPA (TypeScript frontend)
    - Built with Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
    - Serves dashboard at http://localhost:3000 (preview/production)
    - Development server at http://localhost:4000 with HMR
    - Loads scan results from `packages/app/results/`

- **packages/server**: Express backend (TypeScript REST API)
    - RESTful API at http://localhost:3001
    - Handles OAuth token exchange, template validation, and GitHub integration
    - CORS-enabled for frontend communication
    - Serves static frontend assets in production

- **packages/analyzer-core**: Core analyzer functionality (shared library)
    - Shared validation logic used by both server and legacy API
    - Bundled into dependent packages during build

- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
    - `docker-compose.yml`: Multi-container development setup
    - `Dockerfile.combined`: Single-container production build
    - Includes all services (frontend + backend) in one deployable unit

### Legacy Architecture (Azure Functions)

- **packages/api**: Azure Functions (maintained in `legacy/azure-functions` branch)
    - Original serverless implementation
    - Preserved for reference and migration comparison
    - Optional build with `--if-present` flag

### Results Storage

Results live under `packages/app/results/`:

- `packages/app/results/index-data.js` — Master list of scanned templates (window.templatesData)
- `packages/app/results/<owner-repo>/<timestamp>-data.js` — Per-scan data (window.reportData)
- `packages/app/results/<owner-repo>/<timestamp>-dashboard.html` — Per-scan dashboard

# Installation and Setup

## 🚀 New Users - Automated Setup (Recommended)

For first-time setup, we provide a **comprehensive setup wizard** that guides you through everything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Template-Doctor/template-doctor.git
cd template-doctor
./scripts/full-setup.sh
```

The wizard will:

- ✅ Check prerequisites (Azure CLI, azd, Docker)
- ✅ Guide you through GitHub OAuth App creation
- ✅ Help you create a GitHub Personal Access Token with correct scopes
- ✅ Configure MongoDB (existing or new Cosmos DB)
- ✅ Set up admin users and environment variables
- ✅ Optionally configure UAMI for GitHub Actions CI/CD
- ✅ Deploy to Azure with `azd provision` and `azd deploy`
- ✅ Verify the deployment is working

**This is the easiest way to get started!** The script is interactive, validates configuration at each step, and provides helpful troubleshooting tips.

For manual setup or local development only, see sections below.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js LTS** (v20.x, enforced by guard script)
- **npm** (for dependency management)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (recommended for local development)
- **GitHub account** with appropriate permissions

> [!NOTE]
> The project enforces Node.js LTS range: >=20 <23. A guard script (`scripts/ensure-node-version.js`) will fail fast if you use an unsupported version. Use `nvm install 20 && nvm use 20` if needed.

## Quick Start (Docker - Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Template-Doctor/template-doctor.git
    cd template-doctor
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3. **Configure environment**:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit `.env` with your values (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below)

4. **Start with Docker Compose**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

5. **Access the application**:
    - Frontend + Backend: http://localhost:3000

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **OAuth Requirement**: Both frontend and backend run on port 3000 in Docker. This matches the GitHub OAuth callback URL. The Docker setup handles this automatically - both services are accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Manual Development Setup (Not Recommended for OAuth)

If you prefer running services without Docker:

1. **Follow steps 1-3 from Quick Start above**

2. **Build packages**:

    ```bash
    npm run build -w packages/server
    npm run build -w packages/app
    ```

3. **Start services in SEPARATE terminals**:

    **Terminal 1 - Express Backend (port 3001)**:

    ```bash
    cd packages/server
    npm run dev
    ```

    **Terminal 2 - Vite Dev Server (port 4000)**:

    ```bash
    cd packages/app
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Access the application**: http://localhost:4000

> [!WARNING]
> **OAuth Limitation**: This manual setup runs frontend (port 4000) and backend (port 3001) on different ports. OAuth authentication will NOT work correctly unless you create a separate GitHub OAuth app configured for port 4000. For OAuth functionality, use the Docker Compose setup instead (port 3000 for both services).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Express backend MUST be running before using OAuth login or analysis features.
> Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R) required after config changes.

### Port Allocation

| Service         | Development | Preview | Docker |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| Vite Dev Server | 4000        | -       | -      |
| Vite Preview    | -           | 3000    | 3000   |
| Express Backend | 3001        | 3001    | 3001   |

## Authentication Setup

### GitHub OAuth Authentication

1. Create a GitHub OAuth app with appropriate callback URL
2. Configure environment variables or config.json settings
3. See [OAuth Configuration Guide](docs/development/OAUTH_CONFIGURATION.md) for detailed instructions

> [!WARNING]
> You will need different app registrations for local and production environments.

### Azure Managed Identity Setup (for AZD deployment)

1. Run `npm run setup:uami` before you get started
2. Create an `.env` file at the root, using [./.env.example](./.env.example) as a guide
3. See [UAMI Setup Instructions](docs/development/UAMI_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed steps

## Environment Variables

Template Doctor uses a consolidated approach to environment variables. All variables are defined in a single `.env` file at the root of the project.

1. **Copy the example file**:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. **Required variables**:
    - `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth app client ID (required for authentication)
    - `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth app client secret (required for authentication)
    - `GH_WORKFLOW_TOKEN`: GitHub token with workflow permissions

3. **Configuration layers**:
    - **Backend** (`packages/server/.env`): Copied from root during Docker build
    - **Frontend** (`packages/app/config.json`): Client configuration with backend URLs
    - **Environment** (`.env` at repo root): Single source of truth for shared config

See the [Environment Variables Documentation](docs/development/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) for a complete reference of all available variables.

# Usage

## Local Development

### With Docker (Recommended)

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

2. **Start all services**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. **Access the application**:
    - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
    - Backend API: http://localhost:3001

### Manual Development (Two-Terminal Approach)

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

2. **Build packages**:

    ```bash
    npm run build:analyzer-core
    npm run build -w packages/server
    npm run build -w packages/app
    ```

3. **Terminal 1 - Start Express backend**:

    ```bash
    cd packages/server
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Terminal 2 - Start Vite dev server**:

    ```bash
    cd packages/app
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **Open browser**: http://localhost:4000

> [!NOTE]
> The Vite dev server provides hot module replacement (HMR) for fast TypeScript development.
> The Express backend must be running before using OAuth or analysis features.

## Testing

### Run All Tests

From the project root:

```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:ui    # Run tests with UI
npm run test:debug # Run tests in debug mode
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
npm run test -- "-g" "should handle search functionality" packages/app/tests/app.spec.js
```

### Playwright Browser Guard (Fail‑Fast)

End‑to‑end tests require Playwright browsers (Chromium at minimum). A misconfigured pipeline that sets `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` without restoring a cached browser directory used to fail late with a missing executable error. We added a proactive guard script `scripts/verify-playwright-browsers.js` (wired via the root `pretest` hook) that:

1. Detects whether a Chromium installation exists in the Playwright cache.
2. Fails fast (non‑zero) with remediation guidance if `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` is set but browsers are absent.
3. Allows intentional bypass (unit‑only jobs) via `PLAYWRIGHT_ALLOW_MISSING=1`.

Typical GitHub Actions snippet (with cache):

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
    with:
        path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-
- name: Install browsers (if cache miss)
    run: |
        if [ ! -d ~/.cache/ms-playwright ]; then npx playwright install chromium; fi
- name: Tests
    run: npm test
```

Unit‑only pipeline example (skip browser requirement deliberately):

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_ALLOW_MISSING=1 npm run test:unit
```

Do NOT set `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` for jobs that execute Playwright tests unless you guarantee a cache restore first.

### API Smoke Tests

For quick end-to-end verification of Express endpoints:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-api.sh                           # Default (http://localhost:3001)
BASE=http://localhost:3001 ./scripts/smoke-api.sh # Override base URL
DRY_RUN=1 ./scripts/smoke-api.sh                 # Print commands only
```

The smoke script verifies:

- Config endpoint (`/api/v4/client-settings`)
- Validation endpoints
- Analysis endpoints
- OAuth flow (if `GITHUB_TOKEN` present)

> [!NOTE]
> Test files use Playwright for E2E testing. Avoid native browser dialogs in code (use notifications) to keep tests stable.

## Build and Deployment

### Build All Packages

```bash
npm run build:all
```

This builds packages in the correct dependency order:

1. `analyzer-core` (shared library)
2. `server` (Express backend)
3. `app` (Vite frontend)

### Docker Deployment

#### Single-Container Production Build

```bash
# Build the combined image
docker build -f Dockerfile.combined -t template-doctor .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env template-doctor
```

The combined Dockerfile:

- Builds all packages (analyzer-core → server → app)
- Serves frontend and API from single Express process
- Optimized for production deployment

#### Multi-Container Development

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### Preview Build Locally

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build:all

# Start preview server (port 3000)
npm run preview -w packages/server
```

Access at http://localhost:3000

## Requirements and Conventions

- **Origin Upstream Requirement**: For provisioning templates with azd, the canonical upstream must be provided in the format `owner/repo`. This is used for `azd init -t <owner/repo>` and ensures the test/provision flow uses the correct azd template.
- **Results Storage**: New scan PRs write to `packages/app/results/` and update `packages/app/results/index-data.js`.
- **Independent Deployment**: Each package is deployable independently via dedicated workflows.
- **TypeScript-First**: All new code should be TypeScript with proper type definitions.
- **No Mocks in Production**: All implementations must be complete and production-ready (see `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md`).

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **OAuth redirect issues**: Ensure ports match between GitHub OAuth app settings and local server
    - Development: Frontend 4000, Backend 3001
    - Preview/Docker: Frontend 3000, Backend 3001

- **Express server not starting**:
    - Check `.env` file exists with required variables
    - Verify port 3001 is not in use: `lsof -i :3001`

- **Docker issues**:
    - Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running
    - Check logs: `docker-compose logs`

- **Port conflicts**: Kill processes if needed:

    ```bash
    lsof -ti :3000 | xargs kill -9  # Frontend preview
    lsof -ti :3001 | xargs kill -9  # Backend
    lsof -ti :4000 | xargs kill -9  # Frontend dev
    ```

- **Configuration mismatch**: Verify `config.json` has correct `githubOAuth.clientId` matching `.env`

## Deployments (CI/CD)

### GitHub Actions Workflows

Located in `.github/workflows/`:

- **smoke-api.yml**: API smoke tests
    - Runs on push/PR to verify Express API endpoints
    - Builds analyzer-core → server → runs smoke tests
    - See badge at top of README

- **Nightly Deploy**: Automated deployment
    - Runs nightly at 02:15 UTC
    - Can be triggered manually via "Run workflow"
    - See details: [docs/usage/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/usage/DEPLOYMENT.md)

- **Submit Template Analysis**: repository_dispatch workflow
    - Saves scan results and opens a PR using `peter-evans/create-pull-request`
    - See setup guide: [docs/usage/GITHUB_ACTION_SETUP.md](docs/usage/GITHUB_ACTION_SETUP.md)

### Publishing Results

- After "Save Results" creates a PR and the PR is merged, results appear on the site after the nightly deploy
- Admins can run the deploy workflow manually to publish immediately
- The UI shows a notification to inform users of this timing

## Deployments (CI/CD)

Workflows under `.github/workflows/`:

- **Azure Static Web Apps (SWA)**:
    - Uses `Azure/static-web-apps-deploy@v1`
    - `app_location: /packages/app`
    - `api_location: /packages/api`

- **Nightly Static Web Apps Deploy (SWA CLI)**:
    - Workflow: `.github/workflows/nightly-swa-deploy.yml`
    - Runs nightly at 02:15 UTC and can be triggered manually via "Run workflow"
    - Requires repo secret `SWA_CLI_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN` (Static Web App deployment token)
    - See details: [docs/usage/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/usage/DEPLOYMENT.md)

- Submit Template Analysis (repository_dispatch):
    - Saves scan results and opens a PR using `peter-evans/create-pull-request`
    - See setup guide (including bot token fallback): [docs/usage/GITHUB_ACTION_SETUP.md](docs/usage/GITHUB_ACTION_SETUP.md)

Publishing results

- After “Save Results” creates a PR and the PR is merged, results appear on the site after the nightly deploy. Admins can run the deploy workflow manually to publish immediately. The UI shows a notification to inform users of this timing.

### Centralized Archive (optional)

Template Doctor can also archive a small JSON metadata file to a central repository for each analysis.

- How to enable and required variables: see
    - Env vars reference: [docs/development/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](docs/development/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)
    - Action setup (archive section): [docs/usage/GITHUB_ACTION_SETUP.md](docs/usage/GITHUB_ACTION_SETUP.md#6-centralized-archive-of-analysis-metadata-optional)

Quick checklist

- In GitHub repo (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
    - Set `TD_API_BASE` to your API base (e.g., `https://<your-swa>.azurestaticapps.net/api`).
    - Optionally set `TD_ARCHIVE_COLLECTION` (defaults to `aigallery`).
- In Azure Functions (Application Settings):
    - Set `GH_WORKFLOW_TOKEN` with Contents & Pull requests write access to the central archive repo (authorize SSO if needed).
- Enable archiving:
    - Globally: set `archiveEnabled: true` in runtime-config, or
    - Per-run: check the “Also save metadata to the centralized archive for this analysis” box in the analyze modal when global is off.

## Contributing

- Add/update tests for features and fixes. Frontend E2E tests live in the app package; run from root via `npm test`.
- Avoid native browser dialogs; use notifications to keep tests stable.
- Format code before committing (packages may include prettier configs and scripts).
- Don't commit generated artifacts like `node_modules/` or large reports.
- Update docs and workflows when changing paths or behavior.

## Security Analysis Features

Template Doctor now includes enhanced security analysis for Bicep files:

1. **Managed Identity Detection**: Identifies when Managed Identity is properly used in Azure resources.
2. **Insecure Authentication Detection**: Identifies and flags insecure authentication methods like:
    - Connection strings with embedded credentials
    - Access keys
    - SAS tokens
    - Storage account keys
    - KeyVault secrets accessed without Managed Identity

3. **Anonymous Access Detection**: Identifies Azure resources that typically require authentication but may be configured for anonymous access.

These security checks can be enabled/disabled in each rule set configuration by setting the `bicepChecks.securityBestPractices` properties:

```json
"bicepChecks": {
  "requiredResources": [...],
  "securityBestPractices": {
    "preferManagedIdentity": true,
    "detectInsecureAuth": true,
    "checkAnonymousAccess": true
  }
}
```
